•	During the development of this Angular application, what specific problems did Observables and shared services help you solve (e.g., duplicate HTTP calls, data synchronization across components), and how would these problems manifest if you relied on imperative data handling instead?
-	I was able to resolve a number of important issues with the aid of observables and shared services. By enabling several components to subscribe to the same data stream rather than each making a separate request, they first avoided making duplicate HTTP calls. This guaranteed constant data throughout the app and decreased wasted bandwidth. Second, they made it possible for all subscribers to automatically update when data in one location changed. Third, they removed the requirement for imperative loops and manual event listeners by merging input and data streams to simplify reactive features like search filtering. These issues would show up as complicated, error-prone imperative code with dispersed state management, stale or inconsistent data displays, and duplicate API calls in the absence of observables.
•	If the application began experiencing performance issues or inconsistent data displays, which parts of your implementation (services, observables, pipes, or routing) would you investigate first, and what concrete changes would you apply to resolve the issue?
-	I would start by looking at the services and observables if the app started to lag or display inconsistent data. I would use operators like shareReplay to cache results in order to address the possibility that services are making excessive API requests. In order to prevent memory leaks, I would additionally ensure that observables are appropriately maintained using the async pipe. After that, I would examine pipes to determine whether any complex conversions are occurring too frequently and transfer that logic to the service. In order to ensure that data isn't being reloaded needlessly when moving pages, I would lastly check routing. The application would function more quickly and maintain data consistency with these modifications.
