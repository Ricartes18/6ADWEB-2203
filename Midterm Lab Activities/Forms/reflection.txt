Working with both Template Driven and Reactive Forms gave me a clear understanding of the different ways Angular manages user input and validation. Template Driven forms showed me how Angular can automatically create and bind form controls through directives in the template, which feels intuitive for smaller, straightforward forms. In contrast, Reactive Forms required me to explicitly define the form structure in the component class, which made me appreciate how Angular provides fine grained control over validation, state management, and dynamic updates.

The most challenging aspect of Template Driven forms was debugging validation errors, since most of the logic lives in the template and isn’t as visible in the component. Using the FormBuilder service simplified the syntax, and breaking the form into smaller FormGroups made it easier to manage. Overall, working through these challenges taught me when to choose each approach and how to adapt my workflow depending on the complexity of the form I was building.
