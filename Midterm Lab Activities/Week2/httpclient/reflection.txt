Reflection:
In this activity, I learned how to use Angular’s HttpClient service to fetch data from a remote API and display it in a component. The exercise helped me appreciate how Angular separates concerns between services (data fetching) and components (presentation). I also realized how useful mock APIs like JSONPlaceholder are for practicing HTTP client programming without needing a backend server.
1.	Angular’s HttpClient was injected into a service to handle API communication. The service used http.get() to call the /users endpoint and returned an observable. The component subscribed to this observable to receive data asynchronously and display it in the template. The HTTP method used was GET, which is standard for retrieving data.
2.	The service managed the HTTP request, keeping data logic separate from the UI. The model defined the structure of the user data, ensuring type safety and consistency. The component subscribed to the service, stored the data, and bound it to the template. Together, they enabled clean retrieval and display of JSON data on the page.
