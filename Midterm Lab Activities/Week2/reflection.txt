With the prior activity, it was easier to do this as angular service was easy to implement and understand, in this activity, I also made use of the currency pipe that was taught last meeting. This not only made the output look more professional but also helped me appreciate how Angular simplifies formatting tasks. Overall, I feel more confident applying these concepts in future projects and see how they contribute to cleaner, reusable code.
