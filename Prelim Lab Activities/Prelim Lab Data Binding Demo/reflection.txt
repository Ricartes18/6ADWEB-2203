Using Angular’s different data binding techniques helped me clearly see how component data drives the user interface. Interpolation showed me how values in the component instantly appear as text on the page. Property binding demonstrated how data can control element attributes like images or form inputs, making the UI dynamic. Class binding revealed how logic can toggle CSS classes to change appearance based on conditions, while style binding allowed me to apply inline styles directly from component values.
